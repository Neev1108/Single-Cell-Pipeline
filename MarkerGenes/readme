The following includes the supporting literature used to create the marker genes files within the directory for scoreCT input.

[Arabidopsis thaliana leaf] (https://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Fplcell%2Fkoaa060) 
Go to Associated data and download the zip file. Once unzipped, open ....s-03. 
The supplemental dataset 3 will contain the known marker genes for cluster annotation. 
We will move a few names around; headers aren't needed. 
A new excel file is created. The cell types are moved to the first column: 'Phloem parenchyma', 'companion cell', 'Bundle sheath', 'Xylem', and so on.
The gene IDs are moved to the second column, and the gene symbols and TAIR aliases are also included to prevent any loss of information in subsequent columns.
Once completed, the excel file is then converted to a CSV file as shown in the marker genes directory.

[Drosophila Melanogaster] (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.04.451050) 
Go to supplementary material and download Table S3. In s similar manner, we open a new excel file and transfer information regarding the cell type and the 
highly expressed genes in the first and second row respectively, excluding any headers. The medium and low genes are excluded.
Once completed, the resulting excel file is converted to a CSV file.

[Danio rerio brain] (https://dx.doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.aar4362) 
Download the Sup3 Supplementary Table. The cells and top 20 markers are isolated into a separate excel file before being exported as a CSV file. 
The first column contains the names of the cells which has been edited to not include hours within the cell names.
Again, the excel file is converted to a CSV file.
